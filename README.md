# Topic-Modeling-K-means-Clustering-for-Grouping-Customer-Reviews

This project focuses on using topic modeling with K-means clustering to analyze and group customer reviews. Topic modeling is a powerful technique that allows us to 
automatically discover hidden patterns and themes within a large collection of text data. By applying K-means clustering, we aim to organize customer reviews into 
distinct clusters based on shared topics or themes. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiments, 
identify common issues or preferences, and ultimately make data-driven decisions to improve their products or services. The combination of topic modeling and 
K-means clustering offers a robust approach to effectively process and make sense of vast amounts of textual data, providing valuable and actionable insights for 
businesses and organizations.
